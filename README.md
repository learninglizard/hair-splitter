NOTES FROM THE AUTHOR:<br><br>
The output will be one *.imscc file and zero or more *.zip files<br><br>
The output files will be located in the same directory as your original imscc file.<br><br>
HOW IT WORKS<br><br>
The 'algorithm' works the same way as one might load groceries onto a conveyor belt at the supermarket.<br><br>
It sorts all files in the *.imscc from smallest to largest<br><br>
Then it begins filling the first 'grocery cart' with all the files your course must have<br><br>
until it finishes with mandatory files or moves on to your course's 'Files' folder<br><br>
It creates new 'grocery carts' as required and continues until it finishes copying all data.<br><br>
Importing the *.imscc file generated by this script into Canvas will generate errors.<br><br>
However, once you import all the zip file parts (*.zip), your course should be completely intact.<br><br>
