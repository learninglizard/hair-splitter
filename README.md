NOTES FROM THE AUTHOR:
The output will be one *.imscc file and zero or more *.zip files
The output files will be located in the same directory as your original imscc file.
HOW IT WORKS
The 'algorithm' works the same way as one might load groceries onto a conveyor belt at the supermarket.
It sorts all files in the *.imscc from smallest to largest
Then it begins filling the first 'grocery cart' with all the files your course must have
until it finishes with mandatory files or moves on to your course's 'Files' folder
It creates new 'grocery carts' as required and continues until it finishes copying all data.
Importing the *.imscc file generated by this script into Canvas will generate errors.
However, once you import all the zip file parts (*.zip), your course should be completely intact.

Pull Requests are welcome :)
